Basic image processing using verilog HDL.

In this project we have done basic image enhancement using verilog HDL. I have focused on image enhancement in the spatial domain, with particular reference to point processing methods like: BRIGHTNESS OPERATION, INVERTING IMAGES, THRESHOLD OPERATION, CONTRAST MANIPULATION. In this project we have first converted JPG format images to hexadecimal format using MATLAB code. This hex file is processed using verilog and output is obtained in BMP(Bitmap) format.Â
