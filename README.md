Basic image processing using verilog HDL.

In this project we have done basic image enhancement using verilog HDL. I have focus on image enhancement in spatial domain,with perticular reference to point processing methods like: BRIGHTNESS OPERATION, INVERTING IMAGES, THRESHOLD OPERATION, CANTRAST MANIPULATION.
In this project we have first convet JPG format image to hexadecimal format using MATLAB code. This hex file is process using verilog and output is obtain in BMP(Bit map) format.
